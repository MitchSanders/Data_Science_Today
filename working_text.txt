Uday - Testing Notes.

Newest changes made to - Clustering is dividing into four major methods. 
Prototype based methods such as K-Means and the multiple variations of centroid based spherical-shaped clustering, such as K-Mode, K-Means++, and Bisecting K-Means.
Hierarchial clustering such as agglomerative where you do not need to pick a number of centroids and visualization can be in dendrograms.
DBSCAN which is useful for non-globularized data and outliers using density of data.
Graph-based clustering such as spectral clustering which uses eigenvectors and similiarity matrixes.
