Data Science is a popular new field. Sometimes it best separates itself as a science separate from Business Intelligence and Statistical Analytics by including these fields plus incorporating Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence and as applied to business is most often today recognized with algorithms associated with what's known as Neural Network and when magnified into deeper layers often called "Deep Learning".

This book hopes to capture many aspects of Data Science today and be a useful guide and reference for those practicioners learning and sharing their growth in knowledge in this exciting new field.
