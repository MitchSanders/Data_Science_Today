# Clustering Analysis

Clustering is dividing into four major methods. 

1. Prototype based methods such as K-Means and the multiple variations of centroid based spherical-shaped clustering, such as K-Mode, K-Means++, and Bisecting K-Means.
2. Hierarchial clustering such as agglomerative where you do not need to pick a number of centroids and visualization can be in dendrograms.
3. DBSCAN which is useful for non-globularized data and outliers using density of data.
4. Graph-based clustering such as spectral clustering which uses eigenvectors and similiarity matrixes.
